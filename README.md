# Predicting Diabetes by Using Random Forest
#Problem Statement:
Diabetes mellitus is a common disease that affects a vast majority of the people in
many parts of the world. Diabetes affects people usually after the age of 20. According to 
WHO statistics, the global prevalence of diabetes among adults above 18 years of age has
risen to 8.5% in 2014. Diabetes prevalence has been increasing more in middle and lowincome
countries. It becomes a cause for other illnesses also like blindness, kidney failure,
cholesterol and heart diseases. The deaths due to diabetes and high blood glucose are on the
rise. Prediction of diabetes at an early stage would help the patients to maintain the sugar
level under control. As data mining techniques prove to be good in predictive analyses, a data
mining approach is used to predict the risk of diabetes in the proposed approach. The
performance of the algorithm is also measured and improved using feature selection and
selection of training set.

#Inspiration To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.

#Technologies Used:R

#Work done:
->Data is analysed and processed already using excel,Feature engineering is also done.
->Reading the dataset
->Divided the dataset into training data and test data.
->Model building using RandomForest algorithm.
->Visualization of the model
->Displaying Confusion Matrix.
